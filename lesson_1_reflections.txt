How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It would allow for quick isolation and elucidate an error if it were introduced in the newer file version. 

It could also show a correction if the newer file corrected the prior one.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

IF MULTIPLE VERSIONS ARE SUPPORTED IN THE FIELD AND THERE'S A BUG FOUND ON A NEWER VERSION, WE CAN SEE HOW FAR BACK THAT BUG EXISTED AND KNOW WHICH CLIENTS TO NOTIFY ONCE IT IS FIXED.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

THE BIGGEST CON OF DOING IT MANUALLY IS THE PROGRAMMER CAN FORGET TO COMMIT AND LOSE TRACK, MAKING THE CHANGE VERY LARGE AND NOT A LOGICAL CHUNK. AUTOMATIC COMMITS CAN RESULT IN FRAGMENTED COMMITS - NOT A LOGICAL UNIT IN ON COMMIT.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

BECAUSE GIT IS FOR CODE MANAGEMENT AND GROUPS OF FILES (CALLED A REPOSITORY) CHANGE TOGETHER, WHEREAS IN GOOGLE DOCS ONE DOCUMENT TYPICALLY HAS NO RELATIONSHIP TO ANOTHER DOCUMENT, AND IT'S ONLY THE CHNGES WITHIN A SINGLE DOCUMENT THAT ARE RELEVANT.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

IF MY CHANGES BREAK CODE, THEN I CAN ALWAYS REVERT TO A PRIOR WORKING VERSION, AND I'LL EVEN BE ABLE TO SEE EXACTLY WHICH CODE CAUSED THE BREAK. CURT FOODY WAS AN IDIOT, AND GARY GASPAR WAS A SUPER IDIOT.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I WANT TO USE GIT TO WRITE CODE FOR PHONES AND TABLETS - GAMES AND UTILITIES!!!! GOD DAMN IT IF I FAIL!!!
