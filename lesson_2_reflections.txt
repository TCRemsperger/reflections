What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

INITIALIZING A REPOSITORY CREATES A (HIDDEN) SUBDIRECTORY .git IN WHICH TO STORE THE LOG DATA (WHICH CONTAINS INFO ON THE VARIOUS COMMITS)

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

STAGING AREA DIFFERS FROM WORKING DIRECTORY IN THAT IT CAN BE COMMITTED TO THE REPOSITORY. THE REPOSITORY STORES COMMITTED FILES AND LOGS THEM.

THE VALUE OF STAGING AREA IS THAT IT LETS THE USER MAKE RELATED CHANGES TO FILES, TO ADD THEM TO THE STAGING AREA, AND THEN FINALLY TO COMMIT THEM TOGETHER AS ONE COMMIT (WHICH IS GOOD, SINCE THESE ARE RELATED CHANGES - IE ONE LOGICAL CONCEPT)
