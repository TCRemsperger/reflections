When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A REMOTE REPO SERVES AS A BACKUP AND ALSO AS A MEANS TO COLLABORATE WITH OTHERS ON A PROJECT. 
IT PERMITS BRANCHING AND KEEPING TRACK OF ALL CHANGES MADE BY ALL CONTRIBUTORS.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT YOUR HARD WORK STOMPED ON BY SOMEONE UPDATING THE REPO. YOU MUST WORK IN A 
CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT TO MAKE PROPER CODE CHANGES.
