When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A REMOTE REPO SERVES AS A BACKUP AND ALSO AS A MEANS TO COLLABORATE WITH OTHERS ON A PROJECT. 
IT PERMITS BRANCHING AND KEEPING TRACK OF ALL CHANGES MADE BY ALL CONTRIBUTORS.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT YOUR HARD WORK STOMPED ON BY SOMEONE UPDATING THE REPO. YOU MUST WORK IN A 
CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT TO MAKE PROPER CODE CHANGES.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

FORKS ARE CLONES ON GITHUB, AND ONLY CLONE FROM ONE GITHUB REPO TO ANOTHER. THEY KEEP 
ORIGINAL SOURCE ISOLATED AND SAFE.

CLONING CAN BE DONE FROM GITHUB TO LOCAL MACHINE AND ALSO LOCAL REPO TO LOCAL REPO

BRANCH EXIST WITHIN A REPO
